What were the four main types of medical datasets analyzed in the project?,"The project analyzed Heart Diagnoses, Laboratory Events, Microbiology Events, and Procedure Codes."
"According to the initial analysis, what were the two most prevalent cardiac-related ICD codes?",The most prevalent ICD codes were I50 (Heart Failure) and I21 (Acute Myocardial Infarction).
"What issue did the numeric semantics in Table 1 reveal about the datasets, particularly laboratory measurements?","The analysis revealed substantial scale heterogeneity, with laboratory measurements exhibiting extreme ranges and high variance."
"During data preparation, how were numerical values extracted from non-numeric entries containing ranges, such as '80-160'?","For entries with ranges, the midpoint of the range was calculated and used as the numerical value."
What action was taken for laboratory results where the `qc_flag` was marked as 'FAIL'?,The corresponding numerical values (`valuenum_merged`) for these rows were set to `np.nan` to exclude low-quality results.
"In the data integration analysis, which two data sources were almost universally present together for the same patients?","The heart and labs datasets were almost universally present together, with 4,855 patients having data from both sources."
What formula was used for robust Z-score standardization to create composite features?,"The formula used was $Z(X) = (X - Median(X)) / (IQR(X) + \epsilon)$, which is robust to outliers."
What clinical concept does the 'Metabolic Stress' composite feature aim to capture?,"It aims to capture metabolic instability by combining Z-scores of Glucose, Lactate, Anion Gap, and Bicarbonate."
"What was the primary purpose of creating two distinct patient profiles, the 'Clustering Profile' and the 'Classification Profile'?",The profiles were created to provide optimized feature subsets tailored for physiological segmentation (clustering) or predictive diagnosis (classification).
Which three internal validation criteria consistently suggested that $k=2$ was the optimal number of clusters for the K-means algorithm?,"The Elbow Method, average Silhouette score, and Calinski–Harabasz index all indicated $k=2$ as the optimal solution."
"In the K-means clustering results, what did the smaller cluster of 347 patients represent?",It represented a high-severity phenotype with elevated values across composite indices like renal failure and metabolic stress.
"For DBSCAN, the optimal configuration of $\epsilon \approx 6.14$ and $min\_samples=5$ was chosen because it maximized the _____ score.",Silhouette
What did the noise points (Cluster -1) identified by DBSCAN represent clinically?,"They represented a 'hyper-acute' phenotype, potentially in early-stage sepsis, with extreme compensatory stress before measurable organ failure."
"Which linkage method was selected for Hierarchical Clustering, and why?","Ward linkage was selected due to its superior Calinski–Harabasz performance and its tendency to produce compact, interpretable clusters."
Which clustering algorithm achieved the highest overall cluster quality based on Silhouette and Davies–Bouldin scores?,"DBSCAN achieved the highest quality scores, uniquely identifying anomalous patients as noise."
What was the main objective of the supervised classification analysis in Chapter 3?,The objective was to build a binary classifier to distinguish ischemic (Class 1) from non-ischemic (Class 0) cardiovascular conditions.
How were the class labels for the classification task derived from the patient data?,"Class labels were derived from primary ICD diagnoses, with the ischemic class defined by codes I20, I21, I22, I24, or I25."
Which classification model achieved the highest Balanced Accuracy (0.860) and ROC-AUC (0.930)?,The Gradient Boosting model achieved the highest performance on these metrics.
"According to the feature importance analysis of tree-based models, what was consistently the most dominant predictor for ischemic classification?",The feature `has_hf` (presence of heart failure) consistently emerged as the dominant predictor.
Which specific ECG channel was selected for the time series analysis and why?,Lead II was selected due to its clinical utility in rhythm assessment.
What was the sampling frequency of the ECG recordings?,The sampling frequency was 500 Hz.
"The five-step preprocessing pipeline for ECG signals included offset translation removal, amplitude scaling, linear trend removal, _____ filtering, and _____ filtering.","ECG band-pass (0.5–40 Hz), notch (60 Hz)"
What was the purpose of applying a notch filter at 60 Hz to the ECG signals?,The 60 Hz notch filter was applied to eliminate powerline interference.
"What dimensionality reduction technique was used to compress each 5,000-sample ECG time series into 10 representative segments?",Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) was used for dimensionality reduction.
What did the consistently high autocovariance values (mean=0.87) in the extracted ECG features indicate?,They indicated a strong temporal correlation characteristic of ECG signals.
"In the time series clustering, what did the Elbow Method for KMeans suggest about the ECG data patterns?",The gradual decrease in inertia without a pronounced elbow suggested continuous variation in ECG patterns rather than discrete clusters.
The low Silhouette Score (0.210) for KMeans clustering on ECG data indicated that the clusters represented _____ rather than discrete clinical states.,continuous processes
How did the hierarchical clustering dendrogram support the hypothesis of continuous variation in ECG patterns?,"It revealed a multi-scale structure, contrasting with the clear binary split seen in the tabular data clustering."
"In the time series clustering, what was the primary finding from the DBSCAN analysis?","DBSCAN produced 27 small clusters and identified 9.4% of patients as noise, supporting the hypothesis of a continuum with local density peaks and idiosyncratic patterns."
Why did the ECG-based clusters show poor correlation with patient demographics and diagnoses?,"The PAA representation likely missed fine-grained details, and Lead II alone may not capture specific disease states."
What was the binary classification task addressed in the time series classification chapter?,The task was to distinguish ischemic from non-ischemic cardiac patients using preprocessed ECG Lead II time series data.
What four distinct methods were used to extract a combined set of 96 features from each ECG time series for classification?,"The four methods were PAA (Piecewise Aggregate Approximation), SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation), DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform), and HRV (Heart Rate Variability)."
"Which model was used as a time series native approach, operating directly on downsampled time series data?",K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was used as the time series native classifier.
"Among the six evaluated models, which one achieved the highest F1-score (0.5758) for time series classification?",The Shapelet classifier achieved the highest F1-score.
What was the overall conclusion regarding the performance of the time series classification models?,"The performance was modest, with the best accuracy only slightly above random chance, indicating fundamental challenges in the task."
"In the feature importance analysis for XGBoost, which type of features dominated the rankings?","SAX features, particularly SAX_28, dominated the feature importance rankings."
What is the likely reason the Shapelet classifier outperformed models using global approximation features like PAA and DFT?,"The Shapelet classifier likely succeeded by matching local, discriminative temporal patterns that may correspond to clinically relevant ECG waveform components."
What was identified as a key limitation of the ECG analysis related to the input signal used?,"A key limitation was using only Lead II signals, which may miss the full spatial information needed for comprehensive ischemic detection."
